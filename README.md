TO test the cli_interface::
STEP 1 ==>>  install nodejs in not installed and also 'npm install --save-dev jest'(either only npm install for installing all dev dependencies)
STEP 2 ==>>  open cmd line on current directory and 'npm install'
STEP 3 ==>>  all test files and batch files included(create your symlink(cmd as admin and mklink todo todo.bat)
STEP 4 ==>>  use ./todo to initiate(commands listed below)
STEP 5 ==>>  

$ ./todo add "todo item"  # Add a new todo
$ ./todo ls               # Show remaining todos
$ ./todo del NUMBER       # Delete a todo
$ ./todo done NUMBER      # Complete a todo
$ ./todo help             # Show usage
$ ./todo report           # Statistics

STEP 6 ==>>  npm test for testing all commands(snapshot included in .zip file)

NOTE:::::::::::::::

Maybe sometimes the ./todo wont work directly in cmd.//please try it once in vscode terminal (surely works :-))
